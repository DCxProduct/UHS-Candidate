# Filament Document Builder

A powerful and simplified Filament PHP plugin to build dynamic document templates (like invoices, certificates, and registration forms) using a full-featured TinyMCE editor, and automatically export them to PDFs with native support for complex scripts like Khmer.

It is designed to easily integrate with standalone Filament panels or with other plugins like `chanthoeun/filament-custom-forms`.

## Features

- **Advanced HTML Designer:** Uses `amidesfahani/filament-tinyeditor` (TinyMCE) instead of the native Tiptap editor to provide robust support for complex HTML structures and native table editing.
- **Dynamic Variables:** Inject runtime database values directly into your text blocks (e.g., `{{ customer.name }}`). Fallbacks safely to a blank space if data is missing (perfect for printing blank forms).
- **Native PDF Engine:** Powered by `carlos-meneses/laravel-mpdf` (mPDF) for pure PHP generation.
- **Complex Text Shaping:** Pre-configured with `autoScriptToLang` and `autoLangToFont` to perfectly render complex alphabets like Khmer natively, without needing headless Chrome or Puppeteer.
- **Easy Integration:** Drop a simple `Action` onto any Filament table to export the current record as a PDF.
- **Support for Filament v4 & v5 (Laravel 10-13).**

## Installation

### 1. Requirements
- PHP 8.2+
- Filament v4.0 or v5.0
- TinyMCE (`amidesfahani/filament-tinyeditor`)
- mPDF (`carlos-meneses/laravel-mpdf`)

*(Note: Node.js, Puppeteer, and Chromium are **no longer required**!)*

### 2. Install via Composer
```bash
composer require chanthoeun/filament-document-builder
```

### 3. Publish & Run Migrations
You can publish the migration file to customize the table prefix or structure before running it:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-document-builder-migrations"
```
After publishing, run the migrations to create the `document_templates` table:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 4. Register the Plugin
Add the plugin to your Filament Panel provider (`app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php`):

```php
use Chanthoeun\FilamentDocumentBuilder\DocumentBuilderPlugin;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->plugin(
            DocumentBuilderPlugin::make()
                // Optional: Customize or remove the navigation group
                // ->navigationGroup('Custom Group') // Move to another group
                // ->navigationGroup(false) // Remove from groups entirely
                // ->navigationIcon('heroicon-o-document-text') // Change the navigation icon
        );
}
```

## Configuration & Publishing

Because this plugin is built with `Spatie\LaravelPackageTools`, all publishing logic is wired up natively.

### 1. Publishing the Config File
To customize default paper sizes, orientations, and margins, publish the config file:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-document-builder-config"
```
This will create `config/filament-document-builder.php` in your application.

### 2. Publishing Translations
To override the default English and Khmer language files, run:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-document-builder-translations"
```

### 3. Publishing the Document Template Resource
If you want complete control over the `DocumentTemplateResource` (e.g., to change its location, permissions, or logic), you can safely publish it to your application by running:
```bash
php artisan filament-document-builder:publish-resource
```
This command intelligently copies the resource files into your `app/Filament/Resources` directory and automatically updates all namespaces. The plugin will automatically detect that you've published the resource and will gracefully yield control, preventing any conflicts.

## Usage

### 1. Creating a Template
1. Navigate to the **Document Builder** resource in your Filament sidebar.
2. Click **Create Document Template**.
3. Set the layout rules (A4, Portrait) in the Template Details tab.
4. Construct your document using the **Document Designer** tab. Because it uses TinyMCE, you can easily insert and modify highly complex HTML tables.
5. If you plan to inject dynamic variables, type them using standard brace syntax (e.g., `Hello {{ name }}!`).

#### Built-in Shapes and Forms Support
This plugin adds several pre-configured shapes to the TinyMCE editor to make designing forms significantly easier:
- Click the **Template** icon in the toolbar (or use the `Shapes` dropdown) to insert pre-made shapes like a **Circle Logo Placeholder**, a **4x6 Photo Box**, a **Rounded Rectangle**, or a **Signature Line**.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts (Text Patterns):** You can also quickly insert shapes by typing the following codes and pressing Space:
    - `#logo` -> Circular Logo Box
    - `#box` -> Square Box
    - `#photo` -> 4x6 Rectangle Photo Box
    - `#checkbox` -> Small Checkbox
    - `#rounded` -> Rounded Rectangle
    - `#oval` -> Oval Shape
    - `#sign` -> Signature Area with "ហត្ថលេខា / Signature"

#### Flexbox Support in mPDF
By default, mPDF does not support modern CSS Flexbox (`display: inline-flex`), which often breaks designs created in TinyMCE. This plugin **automatically polyfills** Flexbox behaviors (such as `inline-flex`, `align-items`, and `justify-content`) directly in PHP during the export process. Your TinyMCE layouts will render pixel-perfect in the final PDF without requiring complex CSS hacks!

### 2. Looping over Data (Table Repeaters)
If you need to iterate over an array or Eloquent relationship (like line items on an invoice), you can use the built-in `{{#foreach}}` syntax directly in your template.

Switch your TinyMCE editor to **Source Code (`<>`)** view and wrap your repeating elements like this:
```html
<tbody>
    {{#foreach items as item}}
    <tr>
        <td>{{ item.description }}</td>
        <td>{{ item.qty }}</td>
        <td>{{ item.price }}</td>
        <td>{{ item.total }}</td>
    </tr>
    {{/foreach}}
</tbody>
```
- The engine will automatically loop through the `items` array or relationship.
- You can access properties of each item using the prefix you define (e.g., `item.`).
- **Bonus:** Inside the loop, you still have full access to global variables from the parent record!

#### Handling Calculations (e.g., Invoices)
The document rendering engine intentionally avoids executing arbitrary PHP code within the template for security and performance reasons. Therefore, you cannot perform inline math like `{{ item.qty * item.price }}` inside the TinyMCE editor.

To handle calculations such as line totals, taxes, or grand totals, you should use **Laravel Eloquent Accessors** directly on your models. 

**Example (Line Item Total):**
On your `InvoiceItem` model, add an accessor:
```php
public function getTotalAttribute() {
    return $this->qty * $this->price;
}
```
Now, you can simply use `{{ item.total }}` inside your `{{#foreach}}` loop!

**Example (Invoice Grand Total):**
On your parent `Invoice` model:
```php
public function getGrandTotalAttribute() {
    return $this->items->sum('total') + $this->tax_amount;
}
```
Then, anywhere in your document, you can output the grand total using `{{ grand_total }}`.

### 3. Additional Data Sources (Multi-Model Support)
If your document requires data from multiple independent models (e.g., a student application form that needs global `SchoolSettings` or a specific `Principal` user), you can map them entirely through the UI without touching any code!

1. In the **Template Details** tab, click **Add to additional data sources**.
2. Give it a Variable Name (e.g., `school`).
3. Select the Database Model (e.g., `App\Models\SchoolSetting`) and choose "First Record" or "Latest Record".
4. The TinyMCE editor will instantly update its **Insert Variable** dropdown to include all the fields from your new model (e.g., `school.name`, `school.address`).

The PDF Engine will automatically execute these queries at runtime and securely merge the data into your document!

### 4. Exporting PDFs from your Resources

To allow users to download a PDF of a specific record or bulk download multiple records, use the built-in Action classes.

#### Row Action (Single PDF)
Add `DownloadPdfAction` to your resource's table actions to download individual records:

```php
use Chanthoeun\FilamentDocumentBuilder\Tables\Actions\DownloadPdfAction;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        // ... columns ...
        ->actions([
            DownloadPdfAction::make('download_pdf')
                ->templateType('invoice') // The type string of the template you created
                // Optional: Customize the filename
                ->filename(fn ($record) => 'invoice-' . $record->id . '.pdf')
                // Optional: Pass custom data (defaults to the $record itself)
                ->recordData(fn ($record) => [
                    'name' => $record->customer_name,
                    'total' => $record->total_amount,
                ])
        ]);
}
```

#### Page Header Action (Bulk PDF)
Add `DownloadAllPdfAction` to your List page header to download multiple records at once (combined into a single PDF with pagebreaks):

```php
use Chanthoeun\FilamentDocumentBuilder\Actions\DownloadAllPdfAction;

protected function getHeaderActions(): array
{
    return [
        DownloadAllPdfAction::make('download_all_pdf')
            ->templateType('invoice')
            ->records(fn () => $this->getFilteredTableQuery()->get()) // Provide the records to export
            ->filename('invoices-export.pdf')
    ];
}
```
